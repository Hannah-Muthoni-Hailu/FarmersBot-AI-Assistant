    "Healthy Bell Pepper Plant": "Maintain consistent soil moisture to prevent blossom end rot and provide a stakes or cages for support to keep ripening fruit off the ground.",
    "Potato with Early Blight": "Apply fungicides containing Chlorothalonil or Mancozeb; ensure plants have adequate nitrogen and avoid overhead watering to prevent spore splash.",
    "Potato with Late Blight": "Highly contagious. Apply specialized fungicides like Ridomil Gold immediately; destroy infected plants and tubers by burying or bagging them\u2014do not compost.",
    "Healthy Potato Plant": "Ensure deep soil hilling to protect developing tubers from sunlight and pests; provide consistent moisture (1-2 inches per week) during the flowering stage.",
    "Healthy Raspberry Plant": "Prune 'floricanes' (spent two-year-old canes) to the ground in late winter; apply a thick layer of organic mulch to keep shallow roots cool and moist.",
    "Healthy Soybean Plant": "Monitor for Aphids and Japanese Beetles during the pod-filling stage; ensure soil contains proper Rhizobium bacteria for natural nitrogen fixation.",
    "Squash with Powdery Mildew": "Apply potassium bicarbonate or neem oil sprays at the first sign of white spots; ensure wide plant spacing for airflow and avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers which promote susceptible soft growth.",
    "Strawberry with Leaf Scorch": "Remove and destroy infected leaves; apply a copper-based fungicide in early spring and avoid over-fertilizing with nitrogen during the fruiting season.",
    "Healthy Strawberry Plant": "Renovate beds after harvest by thinning plants to 6 inches apart; provide consistent water (avoiding the crown) and mulch with clean straw to keep berries off the soil.",
    "Tomato with Bacterial Spot": "Apply a copper-fungicide and Mancozeb tank mix; practice a 3-year rotation (avoiding peppers/potatoes in the same spot) and never work with plants when they are wet.",
    "Tomato with Early Blight": "Prune the lower 'sucker' leaves to prevent soil-borne spores from splashing up; apply Chlorothalonil or copper spray and use a heavy organic mulch around the base.",
    "Tomato with Late Blight": "Extremely destructive; apply fungicides containing Chlorothalonil or Copper immediately. If infection is widespread, pull and bag the entire plant to prevent wind-borne spread to the community.",
    "Tomato with Leaf Mold": "Increase greenhouse ventilation and reduce humidity below 85%; apply protective fungicides like Calcium Polysulfide and prune the center of the plant to maximize airflow.",
    "Tomato with Septoria Leaf Spot": "Remove infected lower leaves and apply copper-based fungicides; use organic mulch to create a barrier between the soil-borne spores and the plant's foliage.",
    "Tomato with Spider Mites or Two-spotted Spider Mite": "Spray the undersides of leaves with Insecticidal Soap or Neem Oil; increase humidity around the plant and blast foliage with a strong stream of water to dislodge the mites.",
    "Tomato with Target Spot": "Improve air circulation through staking and pruning; apply fungicides containing Azoxystrobin or Chlorothalonil when symptoms (concentric rings) first appear.",
    "Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus": "No cure exists; focus on controlling the Whitefly vector with yellow sticky traps or systemic insecticides, and remove infected plants to protect healthy neighbors.",
